        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <p>Michael: Sometimes I’ll start a sentence, and I don’t even know where it’s going. I just hope I find it along the way.</p>
        <p>Andy: Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.</p>
        <p>Michael: And I knew exactly what to do. But in a much more real sense, I had no idea what to do.</p>
        <p>Michael: The machine knows-- stop yelling at me! Dwight: There’s no road here!</p>
